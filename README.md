# HandwrittenDigitClassification
This project is built for classifying handwritten digits using MNIST datasets on google colab.
The model gives the accuracy of 97%.
MNIST Dataset Description
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition Dataset contains 60,000 training and 10,000 testing labelled handwritten digit pictures.

Each picture is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels wide, for a total of 784 (28Ã—28) pixels. Each pixel has a single pixel value associated with it. It indicates how bright or dark that pixel is (larger numbers indicates darker pixel). This pixel value is an integer ranging from 0 to 255.
